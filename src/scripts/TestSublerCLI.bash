Despite the best efforts of D.A. Harvey Dent and police commissioner Jim Gordon, the city becomes increasingly unsafe...until a Dark Knight arises. We all know criminals are a superstitious, cowardly lot...so his disguise must be able to strike terror into their hearts. He becomes a bat. Enter Vicky Vale, a prize-winning photo journalist who wants to uncover the secret of the mysterious \"bat-man\". And enter Jack Napier, one-time enforcer for Boss Grissom, horribly disfigured after a firefight in a chemical factory...who, devoid of the last vestiges of sanity, seizes control of Gotham's underworld as the psychotic, unpredictable Clown Prince of Crime...the Joker. Gotham's only hope, it seems, lies in this dark, brooding vigilante. And just how does billionaire playboy Bruce Wayne fit into all of this?}{Genre:Action}{Cast:Michael Keaton, Jack Nicholson, Kim Basinger, Michael Gough, Pat Hingle}{Artist:Michael Keaton, Jack Nicholson, Kim Basinger, Michael Gough, Pat Hingle}{Director:Tim Burton}{Producers:Peter Guber, Jon Peters}{Screenwriterss:Warren Skaaren, Sam Hamm}"
